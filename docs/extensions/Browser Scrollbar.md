## **Appearance Settings**

These options control the visual style of the scrollbar.

- **Scrollbar Width:** Sets the thickness of the scrollbar in pixels. A higher value creates a wider scrollbar.
- **Scrollbar Border Radius:** Adjusts the roundness of the corners for both the scrollbar thumb (the part you drag) and the track. A value of 0 results in sharp corners, while a higher value creates more rounded corners.
- **Scrollbar Thumb Color:** Defines the color of the draggable handle of the scrollbar.
- **Scrollbar Track Background Color:** Sets the color for the background or “track” that the thumb moves along.
- **Enable Scrollbar Shadow Effect:** Check this box to add a subtle shadow to the scrollbar, giving it a modern, layered look and making it stand out from the page content.

## **Behavior Settings**

These options adjust how the scrollbar functions and feels during use.

- **Auto Hide Scrollbar:** Controls the visibility of the scrollbar.
  - **Always Show:** The scrollbar is always visible.
  - **When Scrolling:** The scrollbar only appears when the user is actively scrolling the page and hides shortly after.
  - **Automatically (based on mouse/trackpad):** The behavior is determined by the user’s operating system or device settings.
- **Mouse Scroll Step:** Determines how many pixels the page moves with each “tick” of a mouse’s scroll wheel. A higher number means faster scrolling.
- **Scroll Speed:** Adjusts the smoothness of the scroll animation. A lower number can create a snappier feel, while a higher number results in a smoother, more fluid motion.

## **Position Settings**

This setting determines the scrollbar’s placement on the page.

- **Scrollbar Align:** Choose the position of the scrollbar.
  - **Right Sidebar:** The default and most common position.
  - **Left Sidebar:** Moves the scrollbar to the left side of the browser window.
