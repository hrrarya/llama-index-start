The **Widget Library** is a powerful **extension** within the Divi Essential plugin. It allows you to seamlessly integrate your library templates into specific website areas, such as sidebars and footers.

### Why Use the Widget Library?

While you can create this using the visual builder, with its countless modules and layouts, you may want to display it in specific locations, such as the shop, blog, or portfolio archive sidebar. This is where the Widget Library comes into play.
