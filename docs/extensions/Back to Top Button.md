**Easily guide your visitors to the top of your pages with a stylish and customizable “Back to Top” button. This extension for Divi Essential enhances user navigation with extensive customization options, seamlessly integrating with your Divi theme.**

The Back to Top Button extension for Divi Essential provides a smooth and customizable way for users to quickly scroll back to the top of any page on your Divi website. While Divi offers a default back-to-top button, this extension elevates that functionality by providing significantly more control over the button’s appearance, placement, and behavior.

You can personalize the button to perfectly match your site’s design, choosing from various icon and text combinations, adjusting colors, controlling icon sizes, defining button positioning, and even managing its visibility on different devices. All settings are conveniently managed within the Divi Essential admin area, featuring a real-time preview to see your changes instantly.

✅ **Dependency****:** Please note that this extension relies on Divi’s default “Back to Top Button” option being **enabled**. If Divi’s native back-to-top feature is disabled in your Divi Theme Options, this extension’s button will not be visible.

### **✅ Getting Started**

Enabling and configuring the Back to Top Button is straightforward:

1. **Navigate** to the Divi Essential settings panel in your WordPress dashboard.
2. **Locate** the “Extensions” tab or section.
3. **Find** the “Back to Top Button” extension and ensure it is **enabled**.


Once enabled, you can access its dedicated settings panel to begin customization.
