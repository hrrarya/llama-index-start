The **Clear Divi Cache** extension allows you to manually clear Divi’s static CSS and builder cache with a single click. This feature ensures that any design or settings updates are reflected immediately on your site, eliminating the need for navigating through multiple settings or manually clearing cache folders.

### **✅ Why Use Clear Divi Cache?**

This extension is especially helpful for developers and designers who frequently make design or content changes. Here’s why you might consider using this tool:

- **Instant Updates:** Instantly refresh your site to see recent design changes without delay.
- **Workflow Efficiency:** Save time by clearing cache directly from the admin bar—no need to dig through settings or directories.
- **Improved User Experience:** Ensure that visitors always see the most up-to-date version of your site.


Once activated, the extension adds a **“Clear Divi Cache”** button to the **WordPress admin bar**, visible to users with appropriate permissions. Clicking this button triggers a secure AJAX process to clear Divi’s cached files stored in the et-cache directory—making your development process faster and more efficient.

You can clear the cache from the extension page or directly from the front end using the following steps:

2. Click the button. A loading icon will appear to indicate the process is in progress.
3. Once complete, a success message will confirm that the cache has been successfully cleared.


Cache clearing is handled through a secure AJAX request with proper permission checks and nonce validation to ensure safe and efficient operation.
