## Contact Form

We are using plugin "Contact Form 7" for contact functionality. You can see their documentation for better understanding. <https://contactform7.com/docs/>

If you don't want to go through all the troubles to check their documentation and just want to use the default contact form we provided with this theme, please at least set up the default emails in contact form settings. To do that, please follow the steps below:

1. Get back to the WordPress Dashboard and navigate to Contact Contact Form
2. Choose between **Histudy Contact Form**
3. Click the edit link
4. and then go to the "mail" tab
